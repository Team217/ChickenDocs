            If you want to be one of the best programmers on the team, you need a bit more training before you are
            ready. Some good knoledge is below, so pay attention.

            If you went through these lessons and found yourself pulling out your hair, don't worry! Coding is hard and
            the rest of the programming team is there to help you! If you don't want help from the team, you can always
            bring a rubber duck to program and explain your problems to. You must be motivated to code, or you'll just
            be lowsing around, bored.

        <h3>
            The best way to stay motivated is to become friends with those around you. Lucky for you, you are stuck with
            those people for the rest of the season! If you aren't picking up what I'm laying down, you have plenty of
            time to befriend them. Friends = Motivation.

        <h3>
            Write good code the first time you program! Document it with comments and name variables correctly. This
            prevents another programmer having to go back and fix code that was written poorly. This is a time consuming
            and lengthy process, so we are wasting time we could be putting towards more important tasks.

            If you're still confused, you're probably not alone. Below will be some links to other resources to help
            explain programming a bit better. Choose at least one, and read it fully before continuing.
