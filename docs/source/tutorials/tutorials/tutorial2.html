            Java is special in that you have to declare variable types before the variable name. If you're familiar with
            JavaScript, you can just do "var num = 0" or "var welcome = "hello". With Java, it's a little more
            complicated. In Java, you have to say what your variable is. Is it a number, string, double, or some other
            type? Some common data types we use are:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>double - A type of number capaple of storing decimal numbers with a high degree of precision</li>
                <li>boolean - True or False</li>
                <li>string - Like a sentence or word</li>
            </ul>
            There are many more than just these data types, but a few that we use the most often. You can code them like
            this:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="codebox">
                double numberOfNuggets = 10.51;<br>
                boolean matchesNumberOnBox = False;<br>
                string messageToEmployee = "Get it together";
            </div>

            How do I create variables?
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <h3>
            Ah, sweet old Java. It's never simple... Anyway, there are a few "parameters" you can declare before you
            create your variable.
            <ul>
                <li>public - Allows you to access the variable from any file (Learn more about this below)</li>
                <li>private - A variable contained in one file alone</li>
                <li>static - So that you don't need to instantiate the class to use the variable</li>
                <li>final - Once the variable is declared, it cannot be changed</li>
            </ul>

            What are classes?
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body accent">
        <h3>
            Imagine your room. Now, take everything out of your room so that it is empty. This is what a class is. In a
            class, you can create functions, variables, loops, really anything. You can have mutliple classes working
            all together to do multiple different things. But how do we do that? You can code classes like this:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="codebox">
                public class Robot {<br>
                &emsp;public double numberOfNuggets = 10.51;<br>
                &emsp;private boolean matchesNumberOnBox = False; <comment>// Notice this is private</comment>
                <br>
                &emsp;public string messageToEmployee = "Get it together";<br>
                }
            </div>
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div class="title center">
        <h1>
            What are objects?
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <h3>
            An object is an instance of a class. You can't just magically use everything in a class in other classes.
            You must first create an object! Once you create the object, anything in the class is now accessible
            through that object. You can code them like this:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="codebox">
                Robot robotObject = new Robot();<br>
                robotObject.numberOfNuggets; <comment>// 10.51</comment><br>
                robotObject.matchesNumberOnBox; <comment>// Error: Does not exist</comment><br>
                robotObject.messageToEmployee; <comment>// "Get it together"</comment>
            </div>

        <h1>
            What are loops?
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body accent">
        <h3>
            The easiest way to understand what a loop is - do something over and over again until someone says to stop.
            That is what a loop is! It is an iteration of some code over and over again until it is stopped. The most
            common loop we use is the "for loop". Basically, some code is executed repeatedly a specific number of times
            until a certain condition is met. Another common loop is the "while loop". To sum this one up, it runs while
            "x" = "y"; Until "x" does not equal "y", this loop will run. Examples of both loops are below:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="codebox">
                <comment>// i++ means increase i by 1 each time.</comment><br>
                for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {<br>
                    &emsp;System.out.println(i);<br>
                    }<br>
                    <br>
                    <comment>// The code below results in an infinite loop.</comment><br>
                    while (true == true) {<br>
                    <br>
                    }
            </div>

            What are constants?
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <h3>
            Constants are variables that remain- well... constant! We typically put all of these variables in a
            different file to keep the code nice and squeaky clean. These variables never change!

            What is Camel Case?
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body accent">
        <h3>
            Camel Case is a naming convention in which multiple words are joined together without spaces, and each
            word's first letter is capitalized except for the first word. Adam is a stickler for this! You can learn
            more about Camel Case <a

            Here is an example of a Camel Case variable name:
            <br>
            <br>
            <div class="codebox">
                int camelCaseName = 1;<br>
                string anotherCamelCaseName = "Each word after the first is capitalized!";
