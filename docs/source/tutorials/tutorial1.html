            Before you can start programming, you must know what you are working with. This tutorial will answer these
            questions:
            <ol>
                <li>What is a robot?</li>
                <li>What does a robot do?</li>
                <li>How does a robot work?</li>
                <li>How do I start coding?</li>
                <li>How can I set up the robot for programming?</li>
            </ol>
            There's a lot to do, so let's get started!

            According to ChatGPT, "A robot is a machine that can perform tasks automatically, often with the help of a
            computer program. Robots can be controlled by a human or operate autonomously." This is exactly what a robot
            is, and this is how we will use it in robotics. The robot we will create will do multiple tasks, not only
            controlled by us, but run autonomously, or by itself.

        <h3>
            So we know what a robot is, but what does a robot do? In robotics, we are given a game for our robot to
            compete in. This game can vary from putting PVC pipe on an even taller PVC pipe (Reefscape 2025), to scoring
            rings in different places (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescendo_(FIRST)">Crescendo 2024</a>). We
            create our robot to do these tasks.

            How does a robot work?

    <div class="body accent">
        <h3>
            For a robot to work, you first need a robot to work with. But how do you get a robot? You make it! With the
            help of our departments (Electrical, Mechanical, Design, Programming, Manufacturing, Business, & More), we
            can create our own robot. A robot works by taking code from the programmer, going through wires from
            electrical, and into motor put on the robot by mechanical. Basically, a robot needs many different parts to
            function. No one person can do it all themself!

            In order to start coding, you need a few different programs first. We use WPILib as our main coding
            environment. Ask Adam to set it up for you. You will also need Driver Station! A full list of software you
            may need will be below.
