            This tutorial will answer these questions:

            There's a lot to do, so let's get started!

        <h3>
            There are many concepts you can specialize in! These range all the way from updating firmware to programming
            autonomous commands. Just follow what you like/ feel like doing. A short list of things to specialize in is
            below:
            <ul>
                <li>Vision - Our robots have cameras on them to help align then to a target during auton. Specilize in
                    this if this sounds interesting!</li>
                <li>Swerve - This is how our robot moves. If you like moving parts, tuning wheels, feeling pain,
                    specilize in this!</li>
                <li>LEDs - As explained in the last tutorial, LEDs relay us crucial information visually. If you like
                    pretty lights, specilize in this!</li>
                <li>Functioning Subsystems - You can get to know all the diffent functions of the robot and program
                    them!</li>
                <li>MISC Tasks - There is always something to do. If are not "feeling" any of the things listed above,
                    do various programming tasks and you'll find your place!</li>
            </ul>
