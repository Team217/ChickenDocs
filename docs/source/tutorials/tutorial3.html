            What are subsystems?

        <h3>
            Subsystems are a way for us to divide our code into multiple parts. For example, our robot could have:
            <ul>
                <li>Swerve Subsystem - How we drive the robot</li>
                <li>ScoreArm Subsystem - A movable arm on the robot to score points</li>
            </ul>
            Think of subsystems as different functions of the robot. We use subsystems to keep the code clean. It would
            be very hard to find one function of the robot in one single file. It's like trying to find a needle in a
            haystack! (Except the needle is invisible!). Another use for subsystems is so that multiple people can be
            coding different things on the robot at the same time. Imagine two people trying to edit the same file at
            the same time. It would turn out to be quite the disaster.

            We have used many different driving systems over the years on the team. If you look in our robot graveyard,
            you may notice some robots with different wheels than the rest. We will focus on three: Tank, Arcade, and
            Swerve. If you were paying attention, we mentioned the swerve drivebase above!

        <h3>
            ChatGPT says, "A tank drivebase is a drivetrain that uses two joysticks to control the left and right sides
            of a robot. It's a popular choice for robotics competitions because it offers precise control and
            maneuverability." There are some downsides, however: it has difficulty with strafing, poor traction when
            turning, and generally less agility compared to other drive systems.

            Arcade Drivebase
        </h1>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
        <h3>
            People on GitHub say, "An arcade drivebase is a method of controlling the motors of a tank drive drivetrain
            using two axes of a controller, where one of the axes controls the speed of the robot, and the other the
            steering of the robot." The arcade drivebase is mostly the same as the tank drivebase, but it changes the
            functions of the controller axies.

        <h3>
            Back to ChatGPT! "A swerve drive base is a type of robot drivebase that allows for highly precise and
            versatile movement in any direction. Unlike traditional drivebases that rely on a set of wheels that move
            forward, backward, or rotate (like tank drives), a swerve drive base uses individual wheels, each capable of
            rotating independently." This is the drivebase we use most often, as it is the fastest and most
            maneuverable.
